#Ruby Homework
Some Ruby Problems for a friend.

1. Write a method, "current_time", which will output the current time (E.G. 9:00pm).
2. Write a method, "greeting", which will take in "name" as an arguement and output a message greeting that "name"
with "Good Morning, ______!" if it is the morning (E.G. 5am-10am), "Good Afternoon, ______!" if it is the afternoon (E.G.
11am-4pm), "Good Evening, ______!" if it is the evening (E.G. 5pm-11pm), and "You should be sleeping, _____!" if it is
between midnight and 4am. Please assure that the name input is capitalized (E.G. John and not john or JOHN).
3. Write a method, "age_validation", which takes in a birthdate ONLY in the format of "01/01/1990." If the age is 21 or over, the method should output a message "You are old enough to drink!" Otherwise, the method will output the message "You are not old enough to drink!"
